👨🏻‍💻 I am currently studying Computer Science (Bachelor of Science) at the University of Heidelberg. 

🚋 I am interested in graphs, from Graph Theory to Graph Algorithms. In the area of route planning for public transport, I wrote a bachelor thesis on a speedup technique for an algorithm that outputs Pareto-optimal solutions in terms of arrival time and number of transfers.
